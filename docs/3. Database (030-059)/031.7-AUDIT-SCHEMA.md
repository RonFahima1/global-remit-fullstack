# Audit Schema

## Overview
This document describes the audit logging functionality in the Global Remit application. Audit logs are maintained in the `compliance.audit_logs` table as part of the Compliance schema.

## Audit Logs

Audit logging in Global Remit is implemented through the `compliance.audit_logs` table, which tracks all significant system events and data changes. This centralized approach to audit logging is maintained within the Compliance schema to ensure all audit trails are managed consistently with other compliance-related data.

For complete details on the audit log implementation, including the table schema, indexes, and usage patterns, please refer to the [Compliance Schema documentation](./031.5-COMPLIANCE-SCHEMA.md#4-complianceaudit_logs).

## Audit Log Retention

Audit logs are retained according to the following schedule:
- Active logs: 1 year in the database
- Historical logs: Archived to cold storage after 1 year
- Retention period: 10 years (as required by financial regulations)

## Access Control

Access to audit logs is strictly controlled and limited to:
1. System administrators
2. Compliance officers
3. Authorized auditors

All access to audit logs is itself logged for security purposes.
